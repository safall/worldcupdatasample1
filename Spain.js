  teamHistoryText: `The first Spain national football team was constituted in 1920, 
  with the main objective of finding a team that would represent Spain at the Summer Olympics held in Belgium in that same year.
  Spain made their much anticipated debut at the tournament on 28 August 1920 against the national team of Denmark (runners-up in the last two previous Olympic tournament). 
  The match took place at the Stade Joseph Marien in Brussels. The Spanish managed to win that match by a scoreline of 1–0 thanks to a goal from Patricio Arabolaza,
  who thus became Spain's first international goalscorer.
  This match would also make Spain, at that time, the 28th nation to play a football match. In their next match stage, 
  Spain were set to play their next game against the hosts Belgium; in that match, Spain could not come up with the victory and lost 1–3.`,
  teamChampionshipText: `Spain did not enter the competition until 1934.
  It has failed to qualify for the finals on four occasions, 1954 (Switzerland), 1958 (Sweden), 1970 (Mexico) and 1974 (West Germany),
  and has failed to advance from the group stages on six occasions, at the 1962 FIFA World Cup, at the 1966 FIFA World Cup, at the 1978 FIFA World Cup, at the 1982 FIFA World Cup, at the 1998 FIFA World Cup and the 2014 FIFA World Cup.`
