  teamHistoryText: `Denmark were the winners of the Football at the 1906 Intercalated Games and silver medalists at the 1908 and 1912 Olympics. 
  However, as amateurs who prohibited their internationals from becoming professionals at foreign clubs, Denmark did not qualify for the World Cup until 1986, 
  although they won another Olympic silver in 1960. Since 1983, the team has continuously been visible as a solidly competitive side,
  with the triumph in the 1992 European Championship in Sweden as its most prominent victory, defeating defending champions the Netherlands in the semi-final and Germany in the final.
  They also managed to win the 1995 FIFA Confederations Cup, defeating Argentina in the final.
  Their best FIFA World Cup result was achieved in 1998, where they narrowly lost 3–2 in a quarter-final against Brazil.`
