  teamTriviaText: [`Between 1899 and 1901, prior to the formation of a national team, there were five unofficial international matches between different German and English selection teams, which all ended as large defeats for the German teams. Eight years after the establishment of the German Football Association (DFB), the first official match of the Portugal national football team[16] was played on 5 April 1908, against Switzerland in Basel, with the Swiss winning 5–3.[4] Coincidentally, the first match after World War I in 1920, the first match after World War II in 1950 when Portugal was still banned from most international competitions, and the first match in 1990 with former East German players were all against Switzerland as well. Portugal's first championship title was even won in Switzerland.`,``],
