  teamTriviaText: [`Most captains in a single match

In the 2-1 friendly match against Serbia and Montenegro at Walkers Stadium in Leicester on 3 June 2003, four players wore the captain's armband, including three Liverpool players.  There was widespread dismay in the media and among some former England stars that three players deemed undeserving of the captaincy--Emile Heskey of Liverpool, Phil Neville of Manchester United and Jamie Carragher of Liverpool--were handed the captain's armband as a result of the spate of substitutions that followed the half-time retirement of Liverpool's Michael Owen, who had started the match as captain in the absence of regular captain David Beckham.  Only Owen will be listed as captain in the official match records, however.  The three who took over the armband were merely its temporary custodians.`,`Age Oldest Post-War Captain

  teamHistoryText: `England are one of only eight countries ever to win the World Cup, which they did in 1966 when they hosted the finals. They defeated West Germany 4–2 after extra time to win the World Cup title. Since then, they have generally reached the knockout stages of almost every competition they have qualified for, including a fourth-place finish in the 1990 World Cup. England also reached the semi final of the UEFA European Championship in 1968 and 1996. They were the most successful of the "home nations", in the British Home Championship with 54 wins (including 20 shared wins) before the competition was suspended in 1984. England have had more goalless draws than any other team`,
