  teamHistoryText: `The France national football team was created in 1904 around the time of FIFA's foundation on 21 May 1904 and 
  contested its first official international match on 1 May 1904 against Belgium in Brussels, which ended in a 3–3 draw.
  France play home matches at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, Paris, and the current manager is Didier Deschamps. 
  They have won one FIFA World Cup, two UEFA European Championships, an Olympic tournament, and two FIFA Confederations Cups.
  France experienced much of its success in three major eras: in the 1950s, 1980s, and late 1990s/early 2000s respectively, 
  which resulted in numerous major honours. France was one of the four European teams that participated in the inaugural World Cup in 1930 and, 
  although having been eliminated in the qualification stage six times, is one of only three teams that have entered every World Cup cycle.
  In 1958, the team, led by Raymond Kopa and Just Fontaine, finished in third place at the FIFA World Cup. 
  In 1984, France, led by Ballon d'Or winner Michel Platini, won UEFA Euro 1984.
  Under the leadership of Didier Deschamps and three-time FIFA World Player of the Year Zinedine Zidane, France won the FIFA World Cup in 1998.`
