  teamTriviaText: [`THEY CELEBRATE WITH BEER SHOWERS
In Germany, football victories are not celebrated with champagne: Instead, the players (and fans) shower everyone with beer, preferably from a huge mug.`,`PUBLIC VIEWINGS ARE A BIG DEAL
During big football events and important finals, every café, restaurant, and Biergarten in Germany puts up screens to show the game. Everyone, from kids to grandmas, comes together to watch and cheer. In Berlin and Munich, you’ll also find so-called fan miles at the Brandenburger Tor and on Leopoldstraße: There, up to a million people gather to watch the games together – all dressed in black, red and gold (the German colors)`,'','','',''],
