  teamHistoryText: `Though their football federation was established in 1956, the Saudi Arabia national team did not participate in a tournament until they qualified for the AFC Asian Cup in 1984,
  which they won. They subsequently became one of Asia's most successful national teams,
  reaching the next four consecutive Asian Cup finals and winning two of them (1988 and 1996). 
  They have qualified for every Asian Cup since, but their best performance in that period was reaching the final in 2007.
  Saudi Arabia qualified for their first FIFA World Cup in 1994. 
  Under the leadership of Jorge Solari and with talents like Saeed Al-Owairan and Sami Al-Jaber, 
  reinforced by national veteran Majed Abdullah as team captain, Saudi Arabia beat both Belgium and Morocco in the group stage before falling to Sweden in the Round of 16. 
  Saudi Arabia qualified for the next three World Cups, but did not win a group stage match in any of them. They failed to qualify for the 2010 and 2014 tournaments.
  Saudi Arabia secured qualification for the 2018 tournament, ahead of Australia.
  The team's relative lack of international notoriety is compounded by laws that prevent players from playing for foreign clubs if they hold only Saudi citizenship, 
  which is the case for the vast majority of the players.`,
  teamChampionshipText: `Saudi Arabia did not enter the competition until 1994.
  It has failed to qualify for the finals on eighteen occasions
  and has failed to advance from the group stages on three occasions, at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, at the 2002 FIFA World Cup and at the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
  France has failed to advance from the group stages on six occasions, at the 1930 FIFA World Cup, at the 1954 FIFA World Cup, at the 1966 FIFA World Cup,
  at the 1978 FIFA World Cup,  at the 2002 FIFA World Cup and at the 2010 FIFA World Cup.`
